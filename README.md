3. In HMD, click `enter AR/enter VR` button

5. Above is one default webxr application. You can also open `URL/handlers.html` (e.g.  https://10.186.210.189:10086/handlers.html) or  URL/freehand.html(e.g.  https://10.186.210.189:10086/freehand.html), then it will launch the corresponding webxr application.

### Feature

##### Object manipulation

1. Drag
2. Rotate
3. Scale

### Key Files

This project includes a simple 3D scene to provide some context when demonstrating the result.

The key files implementing the remote display logic are:

- `EnhancedRayGrab.jsx`, define all the hand interaction and the object manipulation logic

‚ÄºÔ∏èTo quickly understand the framework and structure of this project, I recommend looking at `src\ARApp.tsx` first.
